# IBKR International Trading Capability Analysis

## Current MCP Server International Trading Assessment

### ✅ **Underlying Library Support (ib-async)**
Based on our contract creation tests, ib-async fully supports:

**European Exchanges:**
- AEB (Euronext Amsterdam) - Netherlands - EUR
- XETRA - Germany - EUR  
- SWX (SIX Swiss Exchange) - Switzerland - CHF
- LSE (London Stock Exchange) - UK - GBP
- SBF (Euronext Paris) - France - EUR

**Asian Exchanges:**
- TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange) - Japan - JPY
- SEHK (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) - Hong Kong - HKD
- KSE (Korea Exchange) - South Korea - KRW  
- ASX (Australian Securities Exchange) - Australia - AUD

**Forex Markets:**
- All major currency pairs through IDEALPRO exchange
- 24/5 trading capability

### ❌ **Current MCP Server Limitations**

**Market Data Tool Issues:**
1. **USD-Only**: Current `get_market_data()` hard-coded to create Stock(symbol, 'SMART', 'USD')
2. **No Currency Detection**: Cannot auto-detect if symbol needs EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.
3. **No Exchange Specification**: Uses 'SMART' routing only

**Example Failure:**
```python
# Current code tries:
Stock('SAP', 'SMART', 'USD')  # ❌ Wrong - SAP trades in EUR on XETRA

# Should be:
Stock('SAP', 'XETRA', 'EUR')  # ✅ Correct
```

**Trading Tools Missing:**
- No order placement tools implemented yet
- No multi-currency position management
- No international market hours awareness

### 🛠️ **Required Enhancements for International Trading**

**1. Enhanced Market Data Tool:**
```python
def get_international_market_data(symbols_with_exchanges):
    """
    Accept format: "ASML.AEB.EUR,SAP.XETRA.EUR,7203.TSE.JPY"
    Or use symbol database to auto-detect exchange/currency
    """
```

**2. Symbol-to-Exchange Mapping:**
```python
INTERNATIONAL_SYMBOLS = {
    'ASML': ('AEB', 'EUR'),
    'SAP': ('XETRA', 'EUR'), 
    'VOD': ('LSE', 'GBP'),
    '7203': ('TSE', 'JPY'),
    # ... extensive database needed
}
```

**3. Multi-Currency Account Handling:**
```python
# Account summary needs to show:
# - USD: $950,000
# - EUR: €15,000  
# - GBP: £8,000
# - JPY: ¥500,000
```

**4. International Trading Tools:**
```python
place_international_order(symbol, exchange, currency, quantity, order_type)
get_trading_hours(exchange)
convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)
```

### 🌍 **IBKR Account Requirements**

**Paper Trading Account (Current):**
- ✅ Supports international contracts
- ⚠️ May have limited market data subscriptions
- ⚠️ Simplified settlement (no real FX conversion)

**Live Trading Account (Future):**
- ✅ Full international market access
- ✅ Real-time market data subscriptions required per exchange
- ✅ Multi-currency cash management
- ⚠️ Each exchange may require separate data subscription fees

### 📊 **Current Capabilities Summary**

| Feature | US Markets | European Markets | Asian Markets | Forex |
|---------|------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Contract Creation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Market Data (MCP) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Portfolio (MCP) | ✅ | ❌* | ❌* | ❌* |
| Order Placement | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-Currency | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

*May work if positions exist, but tool limitations prevent proper testing

### 🎯 **Recommendations**

**Phase 1: Market Data Enhancement**
1. Add international symbol support to `get_market_data()`
2. Implement symbol-to-exchange mapping
3. Test with major European/Asian stocks

**Phase 2: Trading Implementation**  
1. Add international order placement tools
2. Multi-currency account management
3. Exchange-specific trading hours

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Currency conversion tools
2. Cross-exchange arbitrage detection  
3. International market screening

### 🔍 **Testing Needed**

1. **Market Data Subscriptions**: Verify if paper account has international data access
2. **Contract Qualification**: Test if IBKR can actually resolve international contracts
3. **Account Permissions**: Check if current account allows international trading
4. **Settlement Currency**: Understand how multi-currency positions are handled

## Conclusion

**Current Answer: LIMITED**

The IBKR MCP server CAN theoretically trade on European and Asian exchanges because:
- ✅ ib-async library supports all major international exchanges
- ✅ Contract objects create successfully for international stocks
- ✅ IBKR platform supports global trading

However, the current MCP implementation CANNOT trade internationally because:
- ❌ Market data tool only handles USD stocks
- ❌ No trading tools implemented yet
- ❌ No multi-currency support
- ❌ Hard-coded for US market assumptions

**Effort Required: MODERATE** - The infrastructure is there, but significant enhancements needed to the MCP tools.
