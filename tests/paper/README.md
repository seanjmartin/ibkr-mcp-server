# Paper Testing Implementation Status

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed Cleanup
- **Root directory cleaned** - obsolete test files moved to `archived/` 
- **Scripts organized** - utility scripts moved to `scripts/` directory
- **Documentation created** - comprehensive paper testing strategy document created
- **Strategy document updated** - main testing strategy now links to paper testing strategy

### üîÑ Current Priority: Individual Test Debugging

Before creating the comprehensive long-lived connection test suite, we need to debug and fix the hanging issues in our individual tests.

## Current Test Files

### Working Tests
- **test_client_id_5.py** ‚úÖ - Basic connection and account tests (confirmed working)

### Problematic Tests  
- **test_mcp_tools_paper.py** üîÑ - Individual MCP tool tests with some hanging issues

## Critical Timeout Guidelines

‚ö†Ô∏è **IBKR API Response Time Expectations**:
- ‚úÖ **<2 seconds = NORMAL** - Healthy IBKR API calls complete quickly
- üîÑ **2-10 seconds = SLOW** - May indicate network issues or Gateway load  
- ‚ùå **>10 seconds = HANGING** - Likely IBKR API hanging issue, terminate immediately
- üõ°Ô∏è **2-second delays** - Required between tests for Gateway cleanup

## Debugging Approach

### 1. Run Individual Tests with Timeout Protection
Run each test method individually with strict 10-second timeout limits:

```bash
# Test connection status (should work in <2 seconds)
timeout 10s pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_connection_status_tool -v -s --tb=short

# Test account summary (monitor for hanging - should complete in <2 seconds)
timeout 10s pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_account_summary_tool -v -s --tb=short

# Test portfolio (monitor for hanging - should complete in <2 seconds)
timeout 10s pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_portfolio_tool -v -s --tb=short

# Test market data (known to potentially hang - should complete in <2 seconds)
timeout 10s pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_market_data_tool -v -s --tb=short
```

### 2. Use Automated Test Runner
Execute all 14 individual tests with proper timeout protection:
```bash
# Run automated test script with timeout and cleanup delays
scripts\run_individual_paper_tests.bat
```

### 3. Monitor IBKR Gateway Logs
Request Gateway logs for Client ID 5 when a test hangs to understand what IBKR API call is causing the issue.

### 4. Expected Behavior
- **Fast responses**: Most IBKR API calls should complete in 1-2 seconds
- **Clean connection**: Connection establishment should be quick and reliable
- **Proper cleanup**: All tests should clean up connections properly
- **Timeout protection**: Any test taking >10 seconds is hanging and should be terminated

## Known Issues

### Event Loop Corruption
The global `ibkr_client` needs event loop reset between test runs:
```python
# Critical fix in ensure_paper_connection fixture:
from ib_async import IB
ibkr_client.ib = IB()  # Fresh IB instance with current event loop
```

### Client ID Conflicts
Need proper wait times (10-15 seconds) for Gateway to release Client ID 5 between test runs.

### API Hanging Patterns
- **reqAccountSummaryAsync()**: Known to hang with certain account types
- **reqMarkersDataAsync()**: May hang during market hours or with invalid symbols
- **Connection state**: Need to monitor connection state throughout tests

## Next Steps

1. **Individual Test Debugging**: Run and debug each test method individually
2. **Fix Event Loop Issues**: Ensure proper event loop handling in all tests
3. **Resolve Hanging Issues**: Identify and fix specific API calls that hang
4. **Achieve 100% Individual Success**: All tests should pass individually
5. **Create Comprehensive Suite**: Build single long-lived connection test suite

## Debugging Commands

### Run single test with full debug output
```bash
pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_connection_status_tool -v -s --tb=long --capture=no
```

### Run with timeout monitoring
```bash
pytest tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_account_summary_tool -v -s --timeout=15
```

### Monitor all tests for hanging issues
```bash
# This will run each test individually and show which ones hang
for test in connection_status account_summary portfolio market_data forex_rates currency_conversion symbol_resolution; do
    echo "Testing: test_${test}_tool"
    timeout 15s pytest "tests/paper/test_mcp_tools_paper.py::TestPaperTradingMCPTools::test_${test}_tool" -v -s --tb=short
    echo "Exit code: $?"
    echo "---"
done
```

**Status**: Ready for individual test debugging phase
**Goal**: Achieve 100% individual test success rate before consolidation
