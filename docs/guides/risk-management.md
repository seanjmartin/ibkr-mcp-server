# Risk Management Guide

Comprehensive guide to portfolio protection and risk management using stop losses and safety features.

## Overview

Risk management is crucial for successful trading. The IBKR MCP Server provides advanced stop loss capabilities, emergency controls, and comprehensive safety monitoring to protect your investments.

## Types of Stop Loss Orders

### 1. Basic Stop Loss (STP)

A market order triggered when price hits your stop level.

**Example:**
```
"Set a stop loss on my Apple position at $175"
```

**Characteristics:**
- Executes as market order when triggered
- Guaranteed execution but not guaranteed price
- Best for liquid stocks during market hours

### 2. Stop Limit Orders (STP LMT)

A limit order triggered when price hits your stop level.

**Example:**
```
"Set a stop limit on Microsoft: stop at $400, limit at $395"
```

**Characteristics:**
- More control over execution price
- May not execute if price gaps beyond limit
- Better for volatile stocks

### 3. Trailing Stop Orders (TRAIL)

Stop level automatically adjusts as price moves favorably.

**Example:**
```
"Place a trailing stop on Tesla with 8% trail"
```

**Characteristics:**
- Follows price up, never down
- Captures more of upward moves
- Ideal for trending stocks

## Setting Up Stop Losses

### Basic Stop Loss Setup

1. **Check Current Position:**
```
"Show me my current Apple position"
```

2. **Set Stop Loss:**
```
"Set a stop loss on Apple at $175"
```

3. **Confirm Order:**
```
"Show me my stop loss orders"
```

### Advanced Stop Loss Parameters

**Complete Stop Loss Order:**
```
"Set a stop limit on AAPL: 100 shares, stop at $180, limit at $178, good till cancelled"
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- **Symbol:** AAPL
- **Quantity:** 100 shares  
- **Stop Price:** $180 (trigger level)
- **Limit Price:** $178 (execution limit)
- **Time in Force:** GTC (Good Till Cancelled)

### Trailing Stop Configuration

**Percentage-Based Trailing Stop:**
```
"Place a trailing stop on Microsoft with 10% trail"
```

**Dollar-Amount Trailing Stop:**
```
"Set a trailing stop on Google with $25 trail amount"
```

**How Trailing Stops Work:**
- If MSFT at $400, 10% trail sets stop at $360
- If MSFT rises to $450, stop adjusts to $405  
- If MSFT falls to $405, stop order triggers
- Stop never moves down, only up

## Managing Stop Loss Orders

## Advanced Risk Management

### Position Sizing with Stop Losses

**Calculate Risk Before Entry:**
```
"If I buy 100 shares of Apple at $180 with stop at $170, what's my risk?"
```

**Answer:** $1,000 maximum loss (100 shares Ã— $10 difference)

**Risk-Based Position Sizing:**
- Decide maximum loss per trade (e.g., 2% of portfolio)
- Calculate position size based on stop distance
- Example: $100,000 portfolio, 2% risk = $2,000 max loss
- If stop is $10 away, maximum position = 200 shares

### Portfolio-Level Risk Management

**Assess Total Risk:**
```
"Show me all my stop loss orders with total protected value"
```

**Calculate Concentration Risk:**
```
"What percentage of my portfolio is in tech stocks?"
```

**Monitor Correlation Risk:**
```
"Show me my positions in correlated stocks"
```

### Currency Risk Management

**For International Positions:**
```
"Convert my ASML position to USD equivalent"
"What's my total EUR exposure?"
"Set stop losses on international positions accounting for currency risk"

## Best Practices for Risk Management

### 1. Always Use Stop Losses

**Never Trade Without Protection:**
- Set stops immediately after entry
- Use appropriate stop distance (5-15% typically)
- Don't move stops against your position

### 2. Position Sizing Discipline

**Risk-Based Sizing:**
- Never risk more than 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- Larger positions require tighter stops
- Smaller positions allow wider stops

### 3. Diversification

**Spread Risk Across:**
- Different sectors
- Different countries/currencies
- Different time horizons
- Different market capitalizations

### 4. Regular Review and Adjustment

**Weekly Risk Review:**
```
"Show me my weekly risk summary"
"Are any positions becoming too large?"
"Do I need to adjust any stop losses?"
```

### 5. Emotional Discipline

**Stick to Your Rules:**
- Don't cancel stops in panic
- Don't move stops against your position
- Accept small losses to avoid large ones
- Let the system protect you

## Risk Management Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Moving Stops Against Your Position

**Wrong:** Stock drops, move stop lower to "give it more room"
**Right:** Accept the loss and move on

### 2. Not Using Stops

**Wrong:** "I'll just watch it closely"
**Right:** Set stops automatically and systematically

### 3. Position Size Too Large

**Wrong:** Risk 10% of portfolio on one trade
**Right:** Risk 1-2% maximum per trade

### 4. Inadequate Diversification

**Wrong:** All positions in same sector
**Right:** Spread across sectors, countries, currencies

### 5. Emotional Decision Making

**Wrong:** Cancel stops because "feeling lucky"
**Right:** Trust your system and rules
