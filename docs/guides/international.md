## Currency Considerations

### Understanding Multi-Currency Trading

When trading international stocks, you're exposed to both:
1. **Stock Performance** - The underlying company's performance
2. **Currency Performance** - Exchange rate movements

### Currency Impact Examples

**ASML Example:**
- Stock rises 5% in EUR: ‚Ç¨600 ‚Üí ‚Ç¨630
- But EUR weakens 3% vs USD
- Net USD performance: ~+2%

### Managing Currency Risk

**Convert to USD for Comparison:**
```
"Convert ‚Ç¨650 ASML share price to USD"
```

**Monitor Currency Impact:**
```
"What's the EUR/USD rate today vs last week?"
```

**Portfolio Currency Analysis:**
```
"Convert all my European positions to USD equivalent"
```

## International Trading Workflows

## International Trading Best Practices

### 1. Understand Local Market Conditions

Each market has unique characteristics:
- **European:** Regulated, stable, good liquidity
- **Asian:** Higher volatility, different business culture
- **Emerging:** Higher risk, potentially higher returns

### 2. Monitor Currency Risk

Track both stock and currency performance:
```
"Show me ASML performance in both EUR and USD"
```

### 3. Consider Time Zones

Plan trading around market hours:
- **European:** Trade in US morning
- **Asian:** Monitor overnight, trade during their day
- **Australian:** Overlaps with Asian session

### 4. Diversify Across Regions

Don't concentrate in single geographic region:
```
"What percentage of my portfolio is in each region?"
```

### 5. Use Local Currency Analysis

Understand company performance in local currency first:
```
"How has SAP performed in EUR over the past month?"
```
